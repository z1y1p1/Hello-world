# Hello-world
Greetings from Helen in HK
Doing a PhD is hard - a lot of things to learn, including data - fortunately, there is this program on Coursera called Data Science â€“ hope I can learn something there that can help me to analyse the data from my PhD Project. It would be even nicer if I can meet some classmates to learn together!
